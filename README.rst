Acknowledgement
=====================

We the summer interns team of Development on Aakash
Platform are overwhelmed in all humbleness and gratefulness to
acknowledge our depth to all those who have helped us to put
our ideas and assigned work, well above the level of simplicity
and into something concrete.

We all thank whole heartedly **Prof. D.B. Phatak** for selecting us
a part of his valuable project, constantly motivating for doing
better and showing complete confidence in our work.

We are very thankful to our Project Manager **Mr.Parag Tiwari**
and mentor **Raeha Sandalwala** for their valuable help. They
were always there to show us the right track when we needed
help. With help of their valuable suggestions, guidance and
encouragement, we all were able to complete our tasks properly
and with satisfaction. Also in the process, we learnt a lot other
technical and non technical things from them and we consider
ourselves to be very fortunate to have such Project Manager and
mentor.

We would like to thank Mr. Dilip S able for making our stay
hereas summer interns comfortable and for all his administrative
help. Without him a lot of time would have gone in doing extra
work rather than the main project work. Finally we also like to
thank all other colleagues working in different projects under
Prof. Phatak for helping us at small problems as well as critical
junctures.

Abstract
=========

As the name suggests, “proxyMITY” serves as a “proxy”,
i.e. it provides virtual closeness (proximity) without the
actual classroom. It is a “proxy Multimedia Integration
Tool for You”, that helps teachers create dynamic rich-
media lectures.

“proxyMITY Lectures viewed on Aakash” is an Open
source software product. Published lecture that are released
under the Creative Commons License by Attributions
2.5 are edited and prepared for distribution using
proxyMITY.

The main goal of this project is to enhance the proxyMITY
application previously developed on Android Platform
using Eclipse, android SDK and ADT Plugins to view the
video lectures present in the SD-Card or on a Server using
Aakash tablet. The newer version has enhanced user
experience and added functionalities such as:

• Implementing Drag and Drop feature for enhancing GUI.

• Conducting quiz for self-evaluation of the student.

• Transcripts of the video lectures.

proxyMITY is an Open Source software and it is
implemented using graphical user interface. Therefore it is
going to be freely available. It is Platform Independent,
easy to operate and maintain.
