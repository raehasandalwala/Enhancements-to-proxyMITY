Summary and Conclusion
----------------------

• First we implemented the tree structure using ExpandableListView
  into a Sliding Drawer. The required XML was parsed using XML Pull
  Parser.

• This implementation was tested in Aakash tablet. The video files
  stored in the android device will be displayed through a List View in
  android.

• Video View was used to display the video.

• Seek to function was added with each topic to play the video from
  particular position. Both these features were integrated and again tested
  in the tablet. Menu for Bookmarks and Browse srt file was created
  using the Menu and Menu Items class in Android. For saving the new
  bookmarks Sqlite Database was used. For playing subtitles along with
  the video the corresponding file can be searched through a list of srt
  files.

• After Every 15minutes there will be a quiz session for better
  understanding of the topic.
  
• Transcripts also implemented for better understanding so that user
  can simultaneously listen and read the topic.
