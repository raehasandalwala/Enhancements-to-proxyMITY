Summary and Conclusion
----------------------

• First we implemented the tree structure using ExpandableListView
into a Sliding Drawer. The required XML was parsed using XML Pull
Parser.

• This implementation was tested in Aakash tablet. The video files
stored in the android device will be displayed through a List View in
android.

• Video View was used to display the video.

• Seek to function was added with each topic to play the video from
particular position. Both these features were integrated and again tested
in the tablet. Menu for Bookmarks and Browse srt file was created
using the Menu and Menu Items class in Android. For saving the new
bookmarks Sqlite Database was used. For playing subtitles along with
the video the corresponding file can be searched through a list of srt
files.

• After Every 15minutes there will be a quiz session for better
understanding of the topic.
Transcripts also implemented for better understanding so that user
can simultaneously listen and read the topic.
