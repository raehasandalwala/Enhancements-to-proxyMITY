• SD-Card to view the video lecture.
  Software Interfaces
• The Eclipse Indigo 3.7 shall be used as development
  environment implementing the modules.
• Designing of modules and diagrams is done using
  YUML.
  
**Communications Interfaces**

• WI-FI connectivity will be required to view video
  lecture present on the server.
  
Functional Requirements
`````````````````````````
• Navigate through the lecture: This software shall help the user to
  navigate through the video lecture so that user can jump to any desired
  position in the video lecture.
