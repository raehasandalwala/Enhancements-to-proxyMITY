This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is the requirements
work product that formally specifies Enhancements to
ProxyMITY. The objective of this document therefore is to formally
describe the system’s high level requirements including functional
requirements, non-functional requirements and business rules and
constraints. The detail structure of this document is organized as
follows:

Section 2 of this document provides an overview of the domain that the
proposed application will support. These include a general
description of the application, user characteristics, general
constraints, and any assumptions for this project.
Section 3 presents the detail requirements, which comprise the domain
model.
