DESIGN DOCUMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION
==================================

Resource Requirement
````````````````````
**H/W Requirement**
• Any android operating system supported device
• SD-Card to view the video lecture.

**S/W Requirement**
• The Eclipse Indigo 3.7 shall be used as development
  environment for implementing the modules.
• Designing of modules and diagrams is done using YUML.

Model Used (Iterative Model)
```````````````````````````
  The iterative lifecycle model does not attempt to start with a full
  specification of requirements. Instead, development begins by
  specifying and implementing just part of the software, which can then
  be reviewed in order to identify further requirements. This process is
  then repeated, producing a new version of the software for each cycle
  of the model , until the product is accepted as shown below:

• A Requirements phase- This the Phase in which the requirements for the
software are gathered and analyzed. Iteration should eventually result in a
requirements phase that produces a complete and final specification of
requirements.

• A Design phase- This the Phase in which a software solution to meet the
requirements is designed. This may be a new design, or an extension of an
earlier design.

• An Implementation and Test phase- when the software is coded integrated
and tested.

• A Review phase- This the Phase in which the software is evaluated, the
current requirements are reviewed, and changes and additions to
requirements proposed.
